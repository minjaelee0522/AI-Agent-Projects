TAIPEI, Nov 5 (Reuters) – Taiwan’s Premier Chiang Chia-liang said on Wednesday that the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 2025 forum offers a pivotal opportunity for member economies to strengthen regional supply chain integration amid rising global tensions. “In an era of uncertainty, deeper collaboration can ensure smoother flows of critical goods and components,” Chiang told reporters after meeting with visiting trade ministers.

The premier highlighted Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as a model of resilience and urged partners to adopt common standards on technology transfers and customs procedures. He proposed the establishment of an APEC-wide digital tracking system to reduce delays at ports, noting that “each day of delay can cost global industry billions.”

Chiang also reaffirmed Taiwan’s commitment to work with all APEC members on diversifying energy supplies and securing rare-earth minerals. “We must hedge risks by diversifying our sourcing strategies,” he said.

The forum, hosted this year by Thailand in Bangkok, gathers leaders from 21 economies, representing around 60% of world GDP. Key agenda items include trade liberalisation, digital economy initiatives, and climate resilience. Taiwan, while not a formal member, participates under the name “Chinese Taipei.”

BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) — The APEC 2025 summit opened Wednesday in Bangkok with leaders from 21 Pacific-rim economies cautioning that rising geopolitical frictions threaten the benefits of regional trade. In his opening address, Thai Prime Minister Sudarat Ratanapong highlighted the importance of keeping markets open, even as major powers compete for technological dominance.

U.S. Trade Representative Karen Brooks reiterated America’s commitment to a “free and fair” trade environment, but stopped short of endorsing new tariff rollbacks, citing domestic political pressures. Chinese Vice Premier Wang Rui urged members to “resist decoupling trends” and maintain collaboration on supply chains, while Australian Prime Minister Ellen Hayes called for new initiatives on renewable energy and supply-chain transparency.

Beyond the high-level talks, ministers will convene in working groups on digital trade, small business support, and climate mitigation strategies. Delegates say cybersecurity and data privacy will be major sticking points, with some members pushing for stronger protections against ransomware attacks.

Local vendors in Bangkok’s central district report a surge in business as officials and journalists flood the city, but some residents worry about traffic jams and security cordons. Security has been tightened following regional threats, with Thai police deploying additional troops around conference venues.

## Article 3: APEC 2025: Sustainable development goals under spotlight

As the APEC 2025 summit convenes in Bangkok, sustainability experts say this year’s forum could mark a turning point for climate action in the Asia-Pacific region. Delegates are expected to agree on a collective roadmap to meet key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, with a focus on clean energy investment and marine conservation.

“The Asia-Pacific region is home to some of the world’s most vulnerable coastlines,” said Dr. Amina Rizvi of the International Marine Conservation Society. “If APEC members commit to robust targets now, we can avert catastrophic losses in fisheries and coastal infrastructure.”

Proposals include a US$15 billion regional green bond, pledged by Japan and Canada, to fund renewable energy projects in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, New Zealand has offered to host a centre of excellence for climate-smart agriculture, aimed at helping smaller economies boost crop yields without depleting soil health.

Critics argue that binding commitments remain elusive, as several economies fear the short-term costs of rapid transitions. Indonesian Trade Minister Agus Widjaja warned that any plan must be “phased and equitable,” allowing developing members to safeguard growth.

Journalists on the ground report spirited negotiations behind closed doors, with environment ministers meeting alongside finance officials to hammer out the final text. An official draft seen by the Guardian emphasizes monitoring mechanisms and peer reviews—but stops short of legally enforceable sanctions.

## Article 4: Tech ministers gather at APEC 2025 to discuss digital trade

Tech ministers from the 21 APEC economies met on the sidelines of the APEC 2025 summit in Bangkok on Wednesday to negotiate guidelines for digital trade and e-commerce. Key items included data-flow liberalisation, cross-border data privacy standards, and reducing barriers to cloud-based services.

According to delegates, there is broad agreement on establishing a “trusted data exchange framework” to protect consumer privacy while enabling rapid digital transactions. The framework would include baseline requirements for encryption standards and breach notifications.

South Korea’s Minister of Science and ICT, Lee Eun-jae, said Seoul supports a three-tier approach: “We need clear definitions, robust enforcement, and capacity-building for smaller economies.” The U.S. delegation is pushing for language that prohibits forced data localization, arguing it impedes innovation and competitiveness.

However, some Southeast Asian members caution that too-stringent rules could undermine domestic digital industries still in nascent stages. Malaysia has proposed a carve-out period of five years for developing economies to upgrade infrastructure and regulatory frameworks.

Beyond regulations, ministers also previewed a joint fund to support startups in frontier markets, with initial seed capital of US$200 million from member contributions. The fund aims to incubate fintech solutions for cross-border remittances and small-business e-commerce platforms.

Asian equity markets rose on Wednesday following announcements at the APEC 2025 summit aimed at reducing trade frictions and promoting digital commerce. The MSCI Asia-Pacific index closed up 1.2%, led by technology and industrial stocks.

Investors welcomed comments from U.S. Trade Representative Brooks, who signalled willingness to engage in further tariff talks once digital trade guidelines are finalised. Alibaba Group shares jumped 3.5% after China reiterated support for cross-border e-commerce alliances. Samsung Electronics gained 2% amid pledges for new semiconductors supply-chain accords.

“Clarity on data policy and supply-chain diversification is exactly what markets have been waiting for,” said Richard Chen, a strategist at Pacific Horizons Asset Management. “We’re seeing rotation into tech names, but also into green energy plays after Japan and Canada’s bond announcement.”

Commodity markets were mixed. Oil futures declined 0.8% on the prospect of reduced shipping bottlenecks, while copper surged 1.8% on hopes of infrastructure spending in Southeast Asia. Currencies also shifted: the Thai baht strengthened to a two-week high, and the Philippine peso outperformed peers on anticipated foreign direct investment flows.
