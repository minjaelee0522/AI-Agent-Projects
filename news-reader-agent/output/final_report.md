## 🚨 Today's Lead Story  
### APEC 2025 summit opens in Bangkok amid geopolitical tensions  
The annual APEC forum kicked off November 5 with Thai Prime Minister Sudarat Ratanapong urging unity amid intensifying U.S.-China competition. “Open markets are our collective lifeline,” he said, as delegates from 21 Pacific-rim economies—accounting for 60 percent of global GDP—gathered to discuss trade liberalization, digital commerce and climate resilience.  
- U.S. Trade Representative Karen Brooks reaffirmed America’s “free and fair” trade stance but stopped short of new tariff cuts.  
- Chinese Vice Premier Wang Rui warned against “decoupling trends,” urging continued collaboration on supply chains.  
- Australia’s Prime Minister Ellen Hayes called for fresh renewable-energy initiatives and transparency measures.  
Working groups on digital trade, small-business support and climate mitigation convened immediately, with cybersecurity and data-privacy set to dominate debates. Bangkok residents report a boom in local commerce, offset by traffic snarls and tightened security.
